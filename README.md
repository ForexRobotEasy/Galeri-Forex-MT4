## Expert Advisor Description
The Galeri Forex MT4 Expert Advisor is designed to trade on the MetaTrader 4 platform. It is based on MA (Moving Average) Logic, RSI (Relative Strength Index) filter, and Stochastic indicators. The Expert Advisor is compatible with major currency pairs and is optimized for optimal performance on M5 to H1 timeframes.

The key features of the Galeri Forex MT4 Expert Advisor include:
- Implementation of recommended preset settings for optimal performance
- Continuous operation on VPS (Virtual Private Server) for efficient functioning
- Adaptability to leverage of 1:500
- Implementation of low-risk settings for accounts with less than $6000

## Code Explanation
The code starts with necessary input parameters, such as Moving Average period, RSI period, RSI overbought and oversold levels, Stochastic K period, Stochastic D period, and Stochastic slowing period.

The main trade function, `Trade()`, is defined, which performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves the Moving Average value (`maValue`) using the `iMA` function.
2. Retrieves the RSI value (`rsiValue`) using the `iRSI` function.
3. Retrieves the Stochastic values (`stochK` and `stochD`) using the `iStochastic` function.
4. Checks for a buy signal based on the conditions: `maValue` > 0, `rsiValue` < RSI_Oversold, `stochK` > `stochD`, and `stochK` < 20. If the conditions are met, a buy order is placed using the `OrderSend` function.
5. Checks for a sell signal based on the conditions: `maValue` > 0, `rsiValue` > RSI_Overbought, `stochK` < `stochD`, and `stochK` > 80. If the conditions are met, a sell order is placed using the `OrderSend` function.

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the Expert Advisor. It sets necessary parameters such as optimization disabled, trade expert magic number, trade volume percent, trade stops level, trade slippage, and trade restore stop loss/take profit. It also checks if trading is allowed on the account and enables continuous operation on VPS.

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick. It checks if the account equity is less than $6000 and adjusts the leverage to 1:500 if necessary. It then calls the `Trade()` function to execute trades.

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the Expert Advisor is stopped. It prints a message indicating the reason for stopping.
